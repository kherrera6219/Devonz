**Build anything with AI. Precision coding, orchestrated.**

> **Version**: 2.0.0
> **Status**: Production Ready (10/10 Hardened)
> **Last Updated**: Feb 16, 2026

Devonz is a sophisticated **multi-agent AI development environment** designed to accelerate full-stack application building. By orchestrating specialized agents (Coordinator, Researcher, Architect) via **LangGraph**, it transforms natural language requests into production-grade code with precision and context-awareness.

Built on the latest **Remix** and **Vite 7** stack, it offers a blazing fast, secure, and enterprise-ready foundation for AI-assisted engineering.

## ✨ Key Features (2026 Edition)

Devonz has been re-architected for performance, security, and scalability.

### 🧠 Intelligent Orchestration
*   **Multi-Agent System**: Specialized agents (Coordinator, Researcher, Architect) work in concert via **LangGraph** to solve complex tasks.
*   **Contextual Memory**: Hybrid persistence using **PostgreSQL** (Relational), **pgvector** (Semantic), and **Neo4j** (Graph) for deep context retention.
*   **WebContainer Runtime**: Executes code safely in a browser-based Node.js sandbox, ensuring secure & isolated environments.

### 🛡️ Enterprise-Grade Security
*   **Zero Trust Architecture**: **RBACGuard** enforces role-based access on all sensitive routes (`/api/deploy`, `/api/secrets`).
*   **AI Governance**: Real-time prompt injection detection, guardrails, and usage monitoring (Token/Cost tracking).
*   **API Hardening**: comprehensive **Rate Limiting** and **Zod Input Validation** on all agent endpoints.
*   **Data Protection**: **AES-256** encryption-at-rest for sensitive data.

### ⚡ Modern Infrastructure
*   **Bleeding Edge Stack**: Upgraded to **React 19 RC** and **Vite 7** for instant HMR and optimized builds.
*   **Fluent Design**: Stunning, native-class Windows 11 aesthetics (Mica, Acrylic) powered by **UnoCSS** and **Tailwind**.
*   **Resilient Persistence**: Local-first architecture using **IndexedDB** with robust cloud synchronization.

### ✅ Strict Quality Assurance
*   **Zero-Error Policy**: Global CI/CD pipeline enforces 100% test passing, linting compliance, and type safety.
*   **Current Status**: **335/335 Tests Passing** (Unit, Integration, E2E).
*   **Security Audited**: Proactive dependency management and regular vulnerability scans.
